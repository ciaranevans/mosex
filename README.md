(**Mo**norepo **Se**rverless e**X**ample) ☁️

The idea behind `mosex` is to try and provide an example of a AWS hosted serverless application that is contained within a monorepo.

`mosex` will comprise of:

* Automated Builds
* Automated Tests
    * Unit
    * Integration
* Automated Deployments
* CI/CD

_Now I think about it, `pretzel` is a much more fun name, and it links to the repeatability ideas lol_
