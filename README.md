_An AWS Serverless application within a monorepo_

---

The idea behind `pretzel` is to try and provide an example of a AWS hosted serverless application that is contained within a monorepo.

`pretzel` will comprise of:

* Automated Builds
* Automated Tests
    * Unit
    * Integration
* Automated Deployments
* CI/CD

_The name Pretzel was decided when A: I renamed it from MoSeX (Monorepo Serverless eXample) and B: when I found this gif:_
